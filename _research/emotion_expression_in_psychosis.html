    <p>Is emotion really as simple as smiling when you’re happy, and frowning when you’re angry? 
    The mind combines multimodal information, including seeing, hearing and feeling the outside world, the inner sensation of organs such as the heart and gut, 
    and our previous experiences, to construct the moment-to-moment emotions that we feel.

    Impairments in facial expressivity, motivation, and sociality are the most debilitating features of psychotic disorders, yet they are inadequately treated. 
    In this study, <a href="https://sng-newy.github.io/people.html#jayson-jeganathan">Jayson Jenagathan</a> is using facial emotion detection algorithms, functional brain imaging, and novel tasks including real-time facial feedback and heart rate 
    feedback, to discover the changes in the brain’s emotional circuits that underlie these symptoms.
